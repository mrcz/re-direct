<h1>re-direct</h1>

<h4>What is it?</h4>
Efficiently removes tracking redirects from Google's search results, both
regular ones and in image search. A mutation handler is installed so that
dynamically generated links are washed as well. The script looks at every
link once, and no other elements, so it is very fast.
